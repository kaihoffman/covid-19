# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing. You are awesome!

Please also read the `IN_NEED_OF.md` before submitting your contribution.

Feel free to submit *any* contributions as a pull request.

To do this: You can fork the repository, add your thoughts, and then submit a pull request to the upstream repository (RootITSolutions/covid-19)

For more information about forking and pull requests, see: https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork

The preferred way of communication is English. But if you're not sufficient in this, please still submit your ideas and add the label `needs-translation`! Other contributors
that happen to speak the same language will probably be glad to translate it for you. This is an open-source and community driven project. We are all in this together!
